    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    Welcome! Please Sign Up or Sign In to get started. <br><br>
    If you are a student, you can navigate to the "Groups" tab in order to see your teams. You can
    also create a New Evaluation. <br> Within there, you can choose which Group and Assignment you are
    reviewing for, leave an overall comment, and give ratings<br> and comments for each of your teammates.
    <br><br>
    For instructors and other administrators, you are able to view all students and groups (as well as
    create or destroy them),<br> along with all evaluations. In order to view a specific group, head to the
    Groups tab and "See More" on a group.
