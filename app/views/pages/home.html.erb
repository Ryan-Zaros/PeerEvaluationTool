    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! Please Sign Up or Sign In to get started. <br />
        For any groups that you are in, you can create New Evaluations for them using the link below.<br>
        Within an evaluation, you can choose which Group and Assignment you are reviewing for, <br>
        leave an overall comment, and give ratings and comments for each of your teammates.
        <br><br>

        Admins are able to view all students and groups (as well as create or destroy them), <br>
        along with all evaluations. Using the "Edit Rosters" link in the nav bar, you can update the course roster <br>
        (add and delete students). To view all evaluations within a group, navigate to "Groups" and <br>
        then click "Show Details" on any group.
